# GitChatting Codebase Documentation

Welcome to the GitChatting codebase. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and other relevant information for developers.

## Overview

GitChatting is a web application that allows users to interact with a chatbot for assistance with codebase-related queries. The frontend is built with React and styled using CSS, while the backend services are not included in the provided snippets.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `Frontend`: Contains all the React components, styles, and assets for the user interface.
- `Backend`: Contains the flask server-side logic.

### Frontend Structure

- `public`: Static files like `index.html[, ](file:///Users/ciscorrr/Documents/CisStuff/chormadarchod/Frontend/README.md#7%2C25-7%2C25)manifest.json[, and ](file:///Users/ciscorrr/Documents/CisStuff/chormadarchod/Frontend/README.md#40%2C105-40%2C105)robots.txt`.
- `src`: Source code for the React application, including components, styles, and utility functions.
  - `App.js`: The main React component that orchestrates the user interface.
  - `App.css`: Global styles for the application.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `GithubPopup.js`: A React component for the GitHub URL submission popup.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from the create-react-app build tool.
